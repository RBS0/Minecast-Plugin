# This plugin needs to be on all servers that you want to send tweets.
# Tweets will be sent from server -> Minecast -> Twitter.

# Players need to sign up on https://minecast.io if they want
# tweets to automagically send. It allows the linking of
# minecraft accounts to Twitter accounts for easy handling
# and sending of tweets through their Twitter.

# Server Twitter account
# This should be the handle of your twitter account
# Will be used to automatically tag you if enabled
# Do not include @
handle: drtshock

# Auto update
# This option allows us to check for updates.
# We recommend always leaving this to true so you can
# keep up to date with the latest bug fixes.
auto-update: true

# Check for updates
# This will allow us to just check for updates
# and link you to the download and changelog.
# We advise you to never disable both this and auto updates.
# If auto-update is set to true then this option will do nothing.
check-update: true

# TWEET EXPIRE
# Once a new PendingTweet object is created, how long does a user have to confirm
#   sending the tweet?
# Length in tickets. 100 = 5 seconds.
tweet-expire: 100

# Trust
# Should we check if a player trusts this server to tweet for them every time they join?
# This only queries our API once.
# You can get the trusted URL and then add it to your website or something else if you'd like.
trust-on-join: false
